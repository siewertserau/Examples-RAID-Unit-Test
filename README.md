# Examples-RAID-Unit-Test
Simple XOR RAID-5 Example Code

This code has been created as a working example for learning about unit testing and code improvement using walk-throughs and Agile methods.

As code is improved, I will continue to update, extend to add features used in the file RAID example application.

The code can be used with files, but also with block I/O.
